# clock-in-out

A project for a time card app is requested, designed to track work hours for individuals or teams. Users should be able to clock in and out with ease, view their total hours worked, and possibly access a summary of their work week or month. The app could include features for manual entry or adjustments to times, user registration and login, and a dashboard overview of work times. The aim is for a user-friendly interface that simplifies time tracking for users.
